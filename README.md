# Online registration  
**Simplifying the Registration Process at the Las Nieves 2024 Educational Institution.**  
# Introduction  
In this project, we will explore and detail a joint idea: the creation of an alternative method, specifically a **Web Page**, for the **School Enrollment** process. Our intention is to comprehensively describe how this process will be carried out and what our purpose is.  
# Justification  
From the beginning, one of the main problems identified in the Institutions is related to **Enrollment/Registration** of students, both new and old. There is a clear lack of time and agility in carrying out this process. For this reason, the idea of ​​the **"Online Enrollment"** project emerged through a website that allows all students to join the Educational Institution from their homes, thus avoiding complications such as long lines and loss of time.
# Background
This idea arose after numerous complaints from parents, who argued that they had difficulties **attending in person** due to work commitments, health problems or other personal reasons. We became aware of this situation and looked for a solution that would especially benefit those with limitations to being physically present in the institution.
## Problem Statement
Let's imagine the case of a family whose parents cannot attend school meetings due to work commitments and health problems. As the end of the school year approaches, a physical signature from at least one parent is required to complete the registration process. Given the lack of options close to the school, parents are desperate. Therefore, we propose to offer a solution to these parents and others facing similar obstacles through an **online platform** that facilitates the **enrollment process.**
# hypothesis  
We believe that once the project is implemented, it will meet its objective of streamlining the registration process efficiently and effectively. Our users will be able to do it comfortably from their homes, avoiding the inconveniences associated with in-person meetings. We plan to develop this **Web Page** using various programming technologies, thus demonstrating our training as technical programmers. We hope that this solution will be extended to **other Educational Institutions** once it is successfully implemented at **Las Nieves Educational Institution.**  
  
# Aim  
The main objective of this project is to simplify the registration process at the I.E. Las Nieves, reducing the mess and wait for parents, and streamlining the process for administrative staff. Additionally, we focus on particular cases where parents or guardians cannot attend in-person meetings due to various reasons, such as illness or work commitments. This initiative also seeks to become an **Official Page** of free use for educational institutions in the future.
